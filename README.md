# DistanceOfTwoDates

Dates v1.0

Originally written July, 2015

A program I wrote when I first learned how to use structs. It accepts two dates from the user and then analyzes
them, returning some information about them in relation to each other. 

A sample run:

"Please enter a month: 7
Please enter a day: 4
Please enter a year: 1776

Please enter a month: 6
Please enter a day: 7
Please enter a year: 2018

You chose:
7-4-1776
July 4, 1776
This month has 31 days and is month number 7
This year is a leap year

and

You chose:
6-7-2018
June 7, 2018
This month has 30 days and is month number 6
This year is not a leap year

There are 88,363 days between these two dates
60 of these are leap year days
That's 241 years and 33 days

The date in the middle of these is July 20, 1897
